# Objective ❓

This project aims to confront **ME** to a graphic project that will be extremely demanding in terms of optimization. I will have to study the characteristics of the voxel worlds, and use them along my infographics knowledge to display a lot of elements on screen. Thus, I will have to study different algo/opti to obtain a SMOOTH render (there are many of them). I will also have to manage my memory and data structures properly to be able to travel in a very, very large universe. Once I have achieved that, I will be ready to get to the next level with a full Minecraft clone, which will be even more demanding.
